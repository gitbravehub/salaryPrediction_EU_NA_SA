# General Objective üó∫Ô∏è
To conduct a comprehensive data-driven analysis of software engineer salaries across Europe, South America, and North America, with the aim of understanding regional disparities and developing robust, region-specific predictive models. This analysis seeks to offer a granular understanding of the factors influencing salary variations and to ensure accurate salary predictions that are sensitive to the economic realities of each continent.

**Objective 1:** Granular Salary Analysis by Continent
To perform a detailed analysis of software engineering salaries within each specified geographical context ‚Äî Europe, South America, and North America ‚Äî to understand regional compensation trends and variations.

**Objective 2:** Comparative Regional Analysis
To compare and contrast the salary data across the aforementioned continents, identifying patterns and discrepancies that may influence wage scales in each region.

**Objective 3:** Targeted Model Training
To develop predictive models that are trained on continent-specific data, ensuring that the models account for regional economic factors and are not skewed by disparities in salary ranges between high-wage and low-wage areas.

**Objective 4:** Mitigation of Wage Disparity Impact
To mitigate the impact of wage disparities when aggregating salary data by training separate models for each continent. This approach aims to prevent high-salary regions from disproportionately affecting the predictive accuracy for regions with lower average salaries.

**Objective 5:** Enhanced Accuracy in Salary Predictions
To enhance the accuracy of salary predictions by creating tailored models that take into account the economic and professional nuances of each studied region, thereby providing more relevant insights for stakeholders.
